# All_the_news
Scala project


The all-the-news dataset consists of 23,846 English-language articles published online in 2016. The dataset comes from Kaggle all-the-news by Andrew Thmpson. We will use LSA latent semantic analysis methods to get a numerical representation of the articles, we will do a PCA to condense the data representation and then I will use a classification algorithm like Kmeans to try to classify the results of the LSA and Word2vec lemminization into 10 themes. The objective of the project is to make a thematic classification of the publications and to compare the two methods LSA and Word2vec. The graphs have been realized with matplotlib and seaborn.
